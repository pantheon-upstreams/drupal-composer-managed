# Section Library
Allows saving the section as a template, so we can reuse it again in other 
pages or same pages as a duplicate, whether the section blocks are generic
 or inline the module differentiate between them and builds new instances
  for the inline blocks.

### FEATURES
Content Based: The content editor (Layout Manager) can save any created
 section(s) to the library to reuse it over and over.

Build single, or multiple sections as a template: Save individual section
 or combine multiple sections (or all sections on the page) as a template.

### REQUIREMENTS
Drupal Core Layout Builder module.

### INSTALLATION
Install like any other contributed Drupal module.

See:
 https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-contributed-...
  for further information.

### RECOMMENDATION
You can use this module with Optional modules like:

Layout Builder Modal: Replace the default off-canvas dialog with modal,
 so it will show more modern library.

### SIMILAR MODULES
The key difference between this module and the Layout Builder Library module
 that the latter builds a full page template and is config based. The Section
  Library is content based so the content editor can create templates on the
   fly without import/export configs, also it builds templates for the section
    or multiple combined sections (page) templates.
There is no overlapping between the two modules and you can use both at
 the same time.
